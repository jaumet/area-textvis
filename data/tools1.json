If they are equal, the word is placed in the middle of the scale. However, if there is a imbalance in the uses, the word is drawn towards the more frequently related term. This process is repeated for thousands of other word combinations, creating a spectrum of word associations.

In the case of the \'He\' vs. \'She\', the top 120 trigrams for each were identified. The frequencies of the second word in the trigrams were combined and sorted, and rendered in decreasing frequency-of-use order. A similar process was used to create a ranking for the third (and final) word in the trigrams. Words are sized according to the square root of their use frequencies. The color-coded lines act like paths (a tree structure), enumerating all of the trigrams. The process was identical for the \'I\' and \'You\' version, except that only the top 75 trigrams were used.\"","image_name": "webtrigrams.png","thumb_name": "","Single_Collection": "Collection","SW_SP_CI_CA": "Collection_aggregates","Time": "Static text","Search": "No search related","Data_size": "Large dataset"},
